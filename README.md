# Description:
Receives a list of numbers and do math operations.\
The code has 3 functions:
<br>
1. Average (Calculates the average of all the numbers)
2. Minimum (Finds the lowest number)

Each function will be executed by a single thread of its own that will be created within the code.

After the math operations have concluded the main thread will receive both threads and show the results on the main thread.
